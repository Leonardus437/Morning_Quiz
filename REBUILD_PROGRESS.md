# 🔄 REBUILD IN PROGRESS

## Current Status: npm install --production

This step is **NORMAL** and takes time. Please wait patiently.

## Expected Timeline:

1. ✅ **Downloading base images** (1-2 min) - DONE
2. ✅ **Building dependencies** (1-2 min) - DONE
3. 🔄 **npm install --production** (2-5 min) - **CURRENTLY HERE - PLEASE WAIT**
4. ⏳ **Final build steps** (1 min)
5. ⏳ **Starting containers** (30 sec)

## Total Expected Time: 5-10 minutes

## What's Happening Now:

The build is downloading and installing Node.js packages. This is:
- **NOT frozen**
- **NOT stuck**
- **Working normally**

The warning `npm warn config production Use --omit=dev instead` is harmless.

## ⏰ WAIT HERE:

**Current Step:** `#15 [production 6/7] RUN npm install --production`

**Expected Duration:** 2-5 minutes (depending on internet speed)

**What to do:** 
- ✅ Keep the terminal open
- ✅ Wait patiently
- ✅ Don't press Ctrl+C
- ✅ Watch for progress (it will show package names being installed)

## You'll Know It's Done When:

You see:
```
#15 DONE
#16 [production 7/7] ...
...
Container tvet_quiz-frontend-1  Started
Container tvet_quiz-backend-1   Started
```
