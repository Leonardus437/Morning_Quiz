✅ OFFLINE FEATURES - WORKING!
========================================

GOOD NEWS: Your system IS working offline!

VERIFIED:
✅ Backend accessible
✅ Student login works
✅ Quiz submission endpoint works
✅ PDF generation libraries installed
✅ Excel generation libraries installed
✅ All operations are local (no internet)

========================================
WHY STUDENTS MAY HAVE ISSUES:
========================================

1. QUIZ EXPIRED
   - Quiz countdown finished
   - Solution: Teacher rebroadcasts quiz

2. ALREADY ATTEMPTED
   - Student already took this quiz
   - Solution: This is correct! One attempt per quiz

3. WRONG DEPARTMENT/LEVEL
   - Quiz is for different class
   - Solution: Check student dept/level matches quiz

4. BROWSER TIMEOUT
   - Slow network response
   - Solution: Increase timeout in frontend

========================================
QUICK FIXES:
========================================

FIX 1: Rebroadcast Expired Quiz
- Teacher logs in
- Goes to quiz list
- Clicks "Rebroadcast" button
- Students can now take quiz

FIX 2: Check Student Department
- Make sure student dept/level matches quiz
- Example: Quiz for "Software Development - Level 4"
- Student must be in "Software Development - Level 4"

FIX 3: Increase Browser Timeout
- Frontend needs longer timeout for offline
- Change from 5 seconds to 30 seconds
- This helps on slow local networks

========================================
TEST RIGHT NOW:
========================================

1. Teacher: Broadcast a quiz
2. Student: Login and check quiz list
3. Student: Take quiz and submit
4. Student: Download report

If these work → System is perfect!
If not → Check the specific error message
