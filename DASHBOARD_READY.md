## ❌ If You Still See Simple Dashboard:

### Try Incognito Mode First:
- Chrome: `Ctrl + Shift + N`
- Firefox: `Ctrl + Shift + P`
- Go to `http://localhost:3000/teacher`
- Login: teacher001 / teacher123

If incognito shows the full dashboard, it's definitely browser cache.

### Force Clear Cache:
1. Close browser completely
2. Delete browser cache folder manually:
   - Chrome: `C:\Users\PC\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Cache`
   - Firefox: `C:\Users\PC\AppData\Local\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\`
3. Restart browser
4. Try again
